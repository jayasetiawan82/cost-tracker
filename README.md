# Ecommerce Website

This is a project from my IT course. The assesment was to build a simple calculator tool that could track expenditure, budget, balance as well as work hours. I use figma for design and javascript to implement features.  


## users should be able to

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- Enter Budget amount and expense amount
- Edit expense title and amount
- View summary of the budget, expenses and Balance
- Enter and calculate hours of work 

## Built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Day.js
- Mobile-first workflow

## Notes
- User will be prompted to log-in page, click login to access Budget-tracker page
- Only budget Tracker page and Hours tracker are accessable
